# Lynx's Front End Fever

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is! Write a JavaScript / Coffeescript app using AngularJS that will allow a user to search a repository by name and display a repository's relevant information such as URL, description, forks count, stargazers count, open issues count etc.

Also, display the available issues of a repository in a separate section in the UI:

- Implement the best design possible for the user interface - search and search results, and issues section.
- You can use Twitter Bootstrap and any JavaScript libraries to support AngularJS (Underscore etc).
- Use best practices in writing JavaScript / Coffeescript, CSS, and HTML.
- Write clearly and use proper MVC structure to write the application.

Bonus: Add another section for visualisation chart (using a JavaScript charting library that you already know) for the number of forks, open issues, stargazer count, watchers count, or any relevant information about the repository.

Few useful URLs:

- Sample API URL to search by repository name https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=bootstrap
- API URL to display issues of a repository name https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:username/reponame
- Example: Display Issues of Bootstrap https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=repo:twbs/bootstrap
- API Documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-issues
- GItHub Search API Documentation https://developer.github.com/v3/search/

We could be sneaky and not say anything else, but here's some things we're looking to see:

- An app we can try :)
- Use of existing open source libraries
- Something not looking like a web site from 1993s, We do like how the internet looks today :)

By the way, if you find the Github API a tad too boring, pick something else you like. Without giving any hints, there are a few nice APIs available out there from Star Wars, Cats (of course), ...

### Submission notes

You can just submit by, create a private repo for free on [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or just send us the repo by email. Whatever you prefer.
